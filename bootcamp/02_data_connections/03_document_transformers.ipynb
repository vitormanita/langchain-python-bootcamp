But there were many vital questions concerning the future peace, and they were discussed in an atmosphere of complete candor and harmony.\\n\\nIn the last war such discussions, such meetings, did not even begin until the shooting had stopped and the delegates began to assemble at the peace table. There had been no previous opportunities for man-to-man discussions which lead to meetings of minds. The result was a peace which was not a peace. That was a mistake which we are not repeating in this war.\\n\\nAnd right here I want to address a word or two to some suspicious souls who are fearful that Mr. Hull or I have made \"commitments\" for the future which might pledge this Nation to secret treaties, or to enacting the role of Santa Claus.\\n\\nTo such suspicious souls—using a polite terminology—I wish to say that Mr. Churchill, and Marshal Stalin, and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek are all thoroughly conversant with the provisions of our Constitution. And so is Mr. Hull. And so am I.\\n\\nOf course we made some commitments. We most certainly committed ourselves to very large and very specific military plans which require the use of all Allied forces to bring about the defeat of our enemies at the earliest possible time.\\n\\nBut there were no secret treaties or political or financial commitments.'"
